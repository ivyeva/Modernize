Eva Cruz's Nest Contest Landing Page

This is the page I developed to meet the requirements and Sketch file sent to me as a frontend development test. 

## Overview

Some of the key feautures:
- A responsive form that sends an asynchronous request to the provided URL
- Background color animation
- Phone mask input using javascript regular expression
- The form uses the Fetch API to send data as JSON
